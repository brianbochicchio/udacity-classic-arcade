## Instructions

Use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view) for self-checking your submission.

Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like `Player` and `Enemy`) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`. Also make sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

Your **README.md** file should be updated with instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## How to Play

Use the arrow keys to navigate your player from the grass to the water. Each time you reach the water you will score 100 points. You will also trigger a random bonus item to appear.  The heart grants an extra life. The green gem grants a 200 point bonus. 

The game also tracks your high score until you fresh the game browser.  My best score in testing is 5700.  Can quickly can you beat it?!

Good Luck!
