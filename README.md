## How to Play

Use the arrow keys (&#8679; &#8681; &#8678; &#8680;) to navigate your player from the grass to the water. Each time the player reaches the water their  score increases by 100 points. This also triggers a random bonus item to appear.  The heart grants an extra life. The green gem grants a 200 point bonus. The game also tracks the high score until the game browser is refreshed or closed.

My best score in testing is 5700. Can quickly can you beat it?! Good luck!

## Instructions

Use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view) for self-checking your submission.

Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like `Player` and `Enemy`) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`. Also make sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

Your **README.md** file should be updated with instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

## Contributing

This repository is based on starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, I most likely will not accept pull requests.
